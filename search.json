Il faudra procéder en deux étapes. Une des tables, nommée mesure_individuelle, comprend à elle seule plus de lignes que la totalité des autres qui sont plus d’une centaine. Il s’agit de la traiter à part. La première étape est de scinder le dump en deux parties qui seront stockées en format .RData : Le premier fichier contient les lignes du dump correspondant à la table mesure_individuelle. Le second contient le reste des lignes. Ce découpage prend 5-10’. NB : Cette opération peut être bloquée si le chemin d’accès est trop long, ce qui retourne un message d’erreur commençant par : Error gzfile(file, \"wb\") : argument 'description' incorrect De plus : Warning message .... Dans ce cas, déplacez le dump pour raccourcir le chemin d’accès. Si ça bien fonctionné trouve dans le répertoire de destination (par défaut celui où se trouve le fichier du dump) les deux fichiers .RData. En cas de message d’erreur comprenant Error gzfile(file, \"wb\") : ...', la cause la plus probable est un mauvais chemin vers le fichier dump, ce qui ne devrait pas arriver avec l’organisation suggérée du projet. Ensuite, charge le fichier .RData souhaité. Ce qui fait apparaître dans l’environnement un objet lignes_autres_tables. Si l’connaît les noms des tables dont aura besoin, les charge directement au moyen de la fonction imp_tables_a_partir_des_lignes() en renseignant l’argument tables_a_extraire. Si ne les connaît pas, peut les afficher avec la fonction imp_extraire_noms_tables() … ou bien tout importer (environ 5’) pour effectuer le tri ultérieurement. L’import peut produire des messages d’avertissement (Warning) qui sont informatifs. Comme cet import est un peu long, il y intérêt à en sauvegarder le résultat, par exemple dans le répertoire processed_data. Cette sauvegarde est réalisée au format .RData par la fonction exp_tables_rdata(). Comme la table mesure_individuelle pèse à elle seule plus de la moitié de la base, elle est sauvegardée à part, dans mei_aaaa_mm_jj_hh_mm_ss.RData, tandis que l’ensemble des autres tables sont regroupées danstables_sauf_mei_aaaa_mm_jj_hh_mm_ss.RData. Par défaut ces fichiers sont placés dans le sous-répertoire processed_data du répertoire de travail qui est créé s’il n’est pas pré-existant. Si l’souhaite ne conserver qu’une partie des dataframe afin d’y voir plus clair, peut effectuer une sélection avec la fonction keep() du package gdata, à installer si besoin.

L’opération est assez rapide selon l’état de votre connexion (de l’ordre de 3 à 5 min 🚀).  Quand l’importation est terminée, une centaine de tables au format dataframe apparaissent dans l’onglet “Environnement” de RStudio. Pour éviter d’avoir à répéter cet import, peut en sauvegarder le résultat au format .RData de façon à accéder plus rapidement aux données par la suite. La fonction export_tables_rdata() peut être utilisée pour cela. Elle nomme les fichiers (tables_sauf_mei et mesure_individuelle) en fonction des dates et heures systèmes (pour éviter d’écraser malencontreusement d’anciens fichiers) et les sauvegarde par défaut dans un sous-répertoire /processed_data du répertoire de travail. Si celui-ci n’est pas pré-existant, il est créé. NB: Il est possible de scinder les tables mesure_individuelle en plusieurs parties afin de faciliter le dépôt sur des espaces de stockage (avec taille limité).
